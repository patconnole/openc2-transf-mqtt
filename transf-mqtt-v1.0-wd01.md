### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a widely used publish / subscribe (pub/sub) transfer protocol. This specification describes the use of MQTT as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages.

# 1 Introduction
_This section is non-normative._

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a command is encoded by an OpenC2 Producer (managing application) and transferred to an OpenC2 Consumer (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transport protocol, and the Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.  

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices.  These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device.  The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g., 'deny').
* **Actuator**: The entity that performs the action (e.g., 'Stateless Packet Filtering').
* **Command**: A message defined by an action-target pair that is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.
* **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives Commands.  Note that a single device / application can have both Consumer and Producer capabilities.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.
* **Response**: A message from a Consumer to a Producer acknowledging a command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received request.
* **Target**: The object of the action, i.e., the action is performed on the target (e.g., IP Address).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 1.6 Overview
OpenC2 is a suite of specifications to command actuators that execute cyber defense functions.  These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications. The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile specifications focus on the language content and meaning at the producer and consumer of the command and response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.  
In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:

1. **OpenC2 Producers**: An OpenC2 Producer is an entity that creates commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the command. An OpenC2 Producer may receive and process responses in conjunction with a command.
2. **OpenC2 Consumers**: An OpenC2 Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon an OpenC2 command.  An OpenC2 Consumer may create responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the OpenC2 Producer. 

* The OpenC2 Language Specification [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0](#openc2-lang-v10)] provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for commands and responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the command or response.
* OpenC2 Actuator Profiles specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely) to implement multiple actuator profiles.  Actuator profiles extend the language by defining specifiers that identify the actuator to the required level of precision. Actuator Profiles may define command arguments and targets that are relevant and/or unique to those actuator functions.
* OpenC2 Transfer Specifications utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transport of OpenC2 messages.

The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  A message consists of a header and a payload (_defined_ as a message body in the OpenC2 Language Specification Version 1.0 and _specified_ in one or more actuator profiles). 

The language defines two payload structures:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system known as the OpenC2 "Producer", to one or more systems, the OpenC2 "Consumer(s)", to act on the content of the command.
2. **Response**: Any information sent back to the OpenC2 Producer as a result of the command.

**Figure 1-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange**

OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1-2 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude any particular approach to implementing the needed functionality (for example, the use of an application-layer message signature function to provide message source authentication and integrity). 

![no alt title](./images/OC2LayeringModel.png )

**Figure 1-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 1-1.

**Table 1-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>(standard and extensions) |
| Common Content | [OpenC2 Language Specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/v1.0/oc2ls-v1.0.html) |
| Message | Transfer Specifications<br>(OpenC2-over-HTTPS, OpenC2-over-CoAP, â¦) |
| Secure Transport | HTTPS, CoAP, MQTT, OpenDXL, ... |

* The **Secure Transport** layer provides a communication path between the producer and the consumer.  OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transport protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transport- and content-independent mechanism for conveying requests, responses, and notifications.  A transfer specification maps transport-specific protocol elements to a transport-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.  
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of OpenC2 commands and responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function.  An actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function.  OpenC2 Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.


The components of an OpenC2 Command are an action (what is to be done), a target (what is being acted upon), an optional actuator (what is performing the command), and command arguments, which influence how the command is to be performed. An action coupled with a target is sufficient to describe a complete OpenC2 Command. Though optional, the inclusion of an actuator and/or command arguments provides additional precision to a command, when needed.

The components of an OpenC2 Response are a numerical status code, an optional status text string, and optional results. The format of the results, if included, depend on the type or response being transferred. 

## 1.7 Goal
The goal of the OpenC2 Language Specification is to provide a language for interoperating between functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language used in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer Specifications allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks.

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [[IACD](#IACD)]:

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action 

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions.  OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guides the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and implementation agnostic manner
* **Concise:**  An OpenC2 command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments
* **Abstract:**  OpenC2 commands and responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments
* **Extensible:**  While OpenC2 defines a core set of actions and targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

# 2 Operating Model

This section provides an overview of the approach to employing
MQTT as a message transfer protocol for OpenC2 messages.

> **NOTE:**  Tentative list of Qs the MQTT Transfer Spec 
should answer; feedback on additional questions or questions that 
might be out-of-scope / SEP (someone else's problem) is welcome. 
> - What is the required minimum interoperable topic structure?
>   - A proposal is contained in [2.2 Default Topic Structure](#22-default-topic-structure).
> - What is the OpenC2 message format over MQTT?
>   - See [Section 2.3](#23-message-format)
> - Are there any special requirements for the MQTT ClientId?
>   - See [Section 2.5](#25-mqtt-client-identifier); a proposal for ClientId assignment is TBD.
> - How does a Producer discover the active consumers in a pub/subs space?
> - How does a Producer discover the capabilities of active consumers in a pub/subs space?
>   - The above two questions have an element of _registration_ (making Consumers known to the Producer) vs. _discovery_ (enabling the Producer to know what Consumers are currently active in the Producer's sphere of control). 
>   - _Proposed_: Discovery as defined above is an appropriate topic for a transfer specification, registration is outside the scope of a transfer specification
>   - _Proposed_: Determination of actuator capabilities is outside the scope of a transfer specification, but a transfer specification might facilitate use of the OpenC2 Language's features to make such determination (details TBD)
> - What is the appropriate QoS for MQTT messaging for OpenC2?
>   - See  [Section 2.4](#24-quality-of-service).
> - Should Consumers publish any kind of birth and/or death messages?
> - Should we recommend a maximum keep-alive interval?
> - Do we need to describe the nature / structure of the Consumer Device / Actuator(s)?
> - Is there a need to describe a state model for the Producer or Consumer?


## 2.1 Publishers, Subscribers, and Brokers

When transferring OpenC2 Command and Response messages via MQTT,
both Producers and Consumers act as both publishers and subscribers:

* Producers publish Commands and subscribe to receive Responses
* Consumers subscriber to receive Commands and publish Responses

The MQTT broker and MQTT client software used by Producers 
and Consumers are beyond the scope of this specification, but
are assumed to be conformant with the MQTT v3.1.1 specification 
[[MQTT-V3.1.1](#mqtt-v311)].

## 2.2 Default Topic Structure

> **NOTE:** a brief Slack discussion on this proposed topic structure can be found 
[here](https://openc2-community.slack.com/archives/C5RF00U9Z/p1584121853014300).

The MQTT topic structure below is used to exchange 
OpenC2 messages. The "oc2" prefix on the topic names 
segregates OpenC2-related topics from other topics that 
might exist on the same broker. Topic name components in
brackets (e.g., `[actuator_profile]`) are placeholders for
specific values that would be used in implementation.  For
example, a device that includes a Stateless Packet Filter AP
would subscribe to `oc2/cmd/ap/slpf`.

| Topic  | Purpose   | Producer | Consumer |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| `oc2/cmd/ap/[actuator_profile]`| Used to send OpenC2 commands to all instances of specified Actuator Profile.  |  Pub | Sub   |
|  `oc2/cmd/device_type/[device_type]` | Used to send OpenC2 commands to all instances of a   particular device type. It is assumed that a device of a given type may support multiple APs.  | Pub  | Sub   |
| `oc2/cmd/device_id/[device_id]` | Used to send OpenC2 commands to all APs within a   specific device.  | Pub | Sub |
| `oc2/cmd/action_target/[action_target]`  | Used to send commands to all devices and/or actuators that implement the specified command (i.e., action-target pair)  | Pub | Sub |
| `oc2/cmd/action/[action]`  |Used to send OpenC2 commands to all devices and/or   actuators that implement the specified action.   | Pub | Sub |
| `oc2/rsp`  | Used to return OpenC2 response messages.  | Sub | Pub |


In order to receive commands intended for its security 
functions, a Consumer device registering with the broker 
would subscribe to:
* `oc2/cmd/ap/[acutator_profile]` for all actuator profiles the device implements
* `oc2/cmd/device_type/[device_type]` for that device's TYPE
* `oc2/cmd/device_id/[device_type]` for that device's ID
* `oc2/cmd/action_target/[action_target]` for all action-target pairs in the union set of actuator profiles the device implements
* `oc2/cmd/action/[action]` for all actions in the union set of actuator profiles the device implements

In order to receive responses to the commands is sends, 
a Producer registering with the broker would subscribe to:
* `oc2/rsp`


> **NOTE** (from Duncan Sparrell on Slack):  I think a lot of 
this depends on our model of APs within a âdeviceâ (which 
may be in a âdeviceâ) and what operates at which level (AP/
inner device/outer device) which we havenât discussed much. 
And I think that discussion depend on the âlots of little 
atomic APsâ or âfewer compound APs with optional piecepartsâ 
(which BTW Iâll argue is just the lots of little atomic with 
an added layer). I think the pub/sub discussion âinformsâ 
the atomic/compound AP discussion but I also think reality 
of todays tech informs the discussion and we should look 
at how real world products work today

## 2.3 Message Format

> The format proposed by Dave Kemp in [Language
> Spec issue
> #353](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-oc2ls/issues/353),
> or similar, seems appropriate for use with
> pub/sub protocols. It encapsulates all of the
> needed information.

## 2.4 Quality of Service

> - MQTT defines three quality of service (QoS) levels:
>   - **QoS 0: "At most once"**, where messages are delivered according to the best efforts of the operating environment. Message loss can occur. This level could be used, for example, with ambient sensor data where it does not matter if an individual reading is lost as the next one will be published soon after.
>   - **QoS 1: "At least once"**, where messages are assured to arrive but duplicates can occur.
>   - **QoS 2: "Exactly once"**, where message are assured to arrive exactly once. This level could be used, for example, with billing systems where duplicate or lost messages could lead to incorrect charges being applied.
> - _Proposed_:  QoS 1 is appropriate for at least most OpenC2 applications and should be specified as the default.  In most cases the overhead of QoS 2 does not seem justified.

## 2.5 MQTT Client Identifier

As described in [mqtt-v3.1.1](#mqtt-v311) Section
3.1, _CONNECT â Client requests a connection to a
Server_, the Client Identifier (ClientId) is a
required field in the CONNECT control packet.
Further requirements are contained in Section
3.1.3.1, _Client Identifier_, which defines the
ClientId as a UTF-8 string containing only letters
and numbers of between 1 and 23 bytes (MQTT
servers may accept longer ClientIds).
[mqtt-v3.1.1](#mqtt-v311) provides no further
definition regarding the format or assignment of
ClientIds. 

> **NOTE**: the approach for creating ClientIds
> for OpenC2 MQTT clients is TBD.

# 3 Protocol Mappings

# 4 Security Considerations

* Bare minimum requirement for operational
  instance should be use of TLS 1.2 or higher for
  client-broker connections. Basically, extract
  and use the TLS guidance from the v1.0 HTTPS
  Transfer CS.

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical
Committees consider issues that could affect
security when implementing their specification and
document them for implementers and adopters. For
some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if
you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your
specification might make systems vulnerable to
attack, most specifications, because they involve
communications between systems, message formats,
or system settings, open potential channels for
exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)]
lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion,
deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as
well as potential denial of service attacks as
threats that must be considered and, if
appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs. 

In addition to considering and describing
foreseeable risks, this section should include
guidance on how implementers and adopters can
protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with
this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC
Text on Security Considerations_, IETF
[[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

# 5 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).
